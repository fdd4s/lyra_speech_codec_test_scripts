# lyra speech codec test scripts

## What it does

Scripts to test lyra voice codec https://github.com/google/lyra  

## What is

Lyra is a speech codec by Google of just 3200 bps (400 bytes per second) with amazing quality.  
Some people complained about problems to compile running Bazel in Issues section of Lyra project.  
Actually, all the information to compile is perfectly well explained in official lyra and bazel websites,  
but in order to allow a easy and quick test of this amazing speech codec, I uploaded compiled binaries here to encourage people to test the codec.  
Compiled to run in:  
*PC amd64 with Linux Ubuntu  
*ARM board aarch64 with Linux ARMBian (check out https://github.com/fdd4s/wifi-analytics to know how to run Linux ARMBian in a cheap $20 tv box X88 Pro 10)  
*Android arm64-v8a with min SDK 29, Android 10
